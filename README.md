# Online Queue – Monte Carlo Simulation

**Course**: Simtools 2025/2026

**professor/examiner**: Prof. Dr. Benedikt Mangold

**Authors**: Semanur Asalioglu, Sarah Leugner

## What does the project do?

The **Online Queue** project uses a **Monte Carlo simulation** to model and analyze an online queuing system.  
By running a large number of randomized simulations, the project evaluates queue behavior such as waiting times, queue length, and system efficiency under different conditions.

The simulation helps to better understand how queues perform when arrival times and service times vary.

## Why is this project useful?

This project is useful because it:
- Simulates real-world queue behavior using random variables
- Helps analyze average waiting times and system performance
- Demonstrates the practical use of Monte Carlo methods

It is especially useful for educational purposes and performance analysis.
